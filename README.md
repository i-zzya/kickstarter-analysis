# KickStarter Outcomes
## Project Rundown
In a previous analysis we helped Louise determine if Theater campaigns were successful enough for her to launch a project. Our findings determined Theater campaigns were successful and this led Louise to make an informed decision about her personal project "Fever". She came close to her funding goal in a short amount of time and now wanted to know of launch date vs. funding goals outcomes. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
In order to find the outcomes by launch date we created a pivot table and filtered our dataset by "Parent Category" and "Years". We then selected "Theater" as the only category we are analyzing data for sorted the outcomes in descending order. Finally, to present our data we used a line chart (with markers) to show the relationship between succesful, failed, canceled campaigns and their launch dates.

# Analysis Preformed on Kickstarter Data Set


While analyzing over thousands of different kickstarter projects, our primary focus was to determine the success rate of Theater Campaigns.After cleaning our data set, we learned that of the 912 Theater campaigns in the U.S-512 were successful. It is also important to note that majority of successful campaigns were run in May and June.

Based on our findings Louise is likely to run a successful Theater Campaign kicking it off at the beginning of summer.
